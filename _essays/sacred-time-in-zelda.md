This is a working note for the larger Waypoint thesis: sacred time is not a borrowed veneer but the series’ internal metaphysics. I.e., time is sacrally **mediated** (temples, altars, songs) and **structured** (cycles, returns, restorations). That structure regulates causality in-world without importing external dogmatics. This page will expand into a full essay; for now, it functions as a reference node in the explorer.
